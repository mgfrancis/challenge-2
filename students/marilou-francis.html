          <strong class="firstname">Marilou</strong> is originally from the Philippines but has lived almost half of her life in different countries such as Singapore, Japan and now the US. Prior to moving to the States in mid-2011, she was working for an investment bank in Singapore.  She is hoping to resurrect her career, which is currently in hiatus, by taking programming courses.  At the moment, she tries her best to play a patient and doting mom to her family.</p>
